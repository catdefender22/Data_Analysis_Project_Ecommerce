# SQL-Project-1---eCommerce


 #🔍 Overview
This project is a hands-on SQL analysis of the Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset — a real marketplace operating in Brazil with multiple sellers and thousands of customers. The idea is to treat this like a real data analyst case: dive into the raw data, write exploratory and KPI-driven queries, and surface insights that could actually help a business.

Everything is documented as a step-by-step journal. I walk through what questions I’m trying to answer, what SQL I’m writing to get there, and what I’m learning along the way.
